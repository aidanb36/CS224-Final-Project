# THE ARCADE GAME 
By, Xantia Kansil, Aidan Brown, Heshi Muntiu, Matt McCarthy

# Program Summary:
For our final project we have created an arcade where you have a choice of playing four different games. The games that we have created represent ‘Flappy Bird’, ‘Snake’, ‘Doodle Jump’, and ‘Brick Breaker’. At the home screen, you can use the mouse to click on which game you want to play. It will then direct you to the start up screen for the game you have selected. After you are done playing a game, you can use the ‘Go Home’ buttons to choose a different game to play. 

# DIRECTIONS:
1. Run the program
2. Click to choose your desired game (Flappy Bird, Snake, Doodle Jump, or Brick Breaker)

If you choose Flappy Bird:
1. Choose difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard)
2. Click the space bar to jump
3. Earn points by jumping in between the green pipes without hitting them
4. If you touch a pipe, the game is over
5. Click the 'New Game' button to restart OR 'Go Home' to return back to the home screen of the Arade game

If you choose Snake:
1. Choose difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard)
2. Depending on which difficulty you chose, the speed of the snake will either be very fast or very slow
3. There will be a white ring around food squares to make them more visible, due to the changing background color
4. Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to direct the snake into food squares
5. As you collect food squares, you grow, and the game becomes more difficult
6. If you collect a food item, the background color will change
7. Try to last as long as you can before you either run into a wall or into yourself
8. The game will terminate once you run into a wall or yourself

If you choose Doodle Jump:
1. Click 'New Game' to begin game
2. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the chracter side to side
3. Bounce on the tiles to move up the screen
4. Earn points by jumping on tiles to get as high as you can. The higher you move up, the more points you will earn
5. As you move up the screen, the game becomes more difficult (tiles start to move side to side and become farther apart)
6. If you miss a tile and drop to the bottom of the screen, the game is over
7. Click the 'New Game' button to restart OR 'Go Home' to return back to the home screen of the Arade game

If you choose Brick Breaker:
1. Click the 's' on your keyboard to begin
2. Click the space bar to make the ball start
3. Use your mouse to make the ball bounce off the tile on the bottom of the screen
4. The ball will break the bricks above
5. If the ball falls out of the screen, the game is over
6. 'Go Home' to return back to the home screen of the Arade game

# CONCEPTS USED:

**Polymorphism** (module 3) - many of our classes inherit from the shape classes. They use methods from the shape parent class and use overridden methods like the draw method.

**Graphics** (module 4)

**OS:**
This project runs on Mac and Windows and does not require any installation. 

**Citations:**
The Snake and the Flappy Bird games came from previous Module 4 projects, but were enhanced for this project. Also, the Circle, Rect, and Shape classes are from previous projects (originally Lisa Dion’s). 

**Grade:**
We’ve decided that we deserve an A for this project, due to the amount of time and effort we have all poured into this arcade-game system. Our project was well thoughtout, is complex, includes all the requirements in ways that make sense, is user-friendly, interactive, has clear output, and is defintely fun and interesting.
